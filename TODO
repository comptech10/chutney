- Currently Chuteny does not appear to function with Tor 10.0.12 or Tor 10.0.13.  I get an error: "At least one protocol listed as required in the consensus is not supported by this version of Tor. You should upgrade. This version of Tor will not work as a client on the Tor network. The missing protocols are: DirCache=1"  
I can not find any DirCache in the files that I can flip to zero to try to get it working.  If you have any suggestions, please let me know, If there are none, I suppose you have a bug that you have now been made aware of.  I was not sure how to get this message to you other than this method.
Thank you, 
Dustin
